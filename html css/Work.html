        Improve basic education resources
    </h3>

    <p>School facilities construction: Donations may be used to build or renovate school buildings, libraries, laboratories, provide clean drinking water and sanitary facilities, and improve the learning environment.

Teaching materials and teaching aids: Purchase textbooks, stationery, and technological equipment (such as computers and projectors) to make up for resource shortages.

Teacher training: Improve teachers' professional abilities and indirectly improve teaching quality.</p>

    <h3>
        Expanding educational opportunities
    </h3>

    <p>Reduce dropout rates: Provide tuition, meal or transportation subsidies to poor families to reduce the financial burden and keep children (especially girls and children in remote areas) in school.

Scholarship support: Fund outstanding students to enter secondary school or university to break the cycle of poverty.

Informal education: Support community schools or literacy programs to cover out-of-school children or marginalized groups.</p>

    <h3>
        Direct health benefits
    </h3>

    <p>Reduce waterborne diseases: Providing water purification equipment (such as water filters and wells) can reduce the risk of children contracting diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, and typhoid, which are one of the main causes of death among children in Cambodia.

Improve nutrient absorption: Clean drinking water can reduce parasitic infections and improve the body's absorption of nutrients, which is especially important for children in critical development periods.

Reduce child mortality: Cases of deaths from diarrhea in children under 5 years old can be significantly reduced (according to WHO statistics, about 44% of diarrheal deaths worldwide are related to unsafe drinking water).</p>

    <h3>
        Improved educational opportunities
    </h3>

    <p>Reduce absenteeism: Children take fewer days off due to diarrhea or other water-related illnesses, ensuring learning continuity.

Save time fetching water: Many rural children (especially girls) have to walk for hours every day to fetch water. Donations support community wells or water supply systems that free up time for children to go to school or complete homework.

Improve school environment: After schools install water purification equipment and toilets, students are more willing to go to school, especially adolescent girls who can stay in school during their menstrual period.</p>

    <h3>
        Long-term social impact
    </h3>

    <p>Reduce the burden on families: Reduce family medical expenses, and the money saved can be used for children's education or nutrition improvement.

Break the cycle of poverty: Healthy children are more likely to complete their studies and have higher income opportunities in the future.

Promote gender equality: Reduce the pressure on girls to drop out of school because of collecting water or caring for sick family members.</p>

    <h3>
        Improved educational opportunities
    </h3>

    <p>Safe routes to school: Building or maintaining roads to schools can reduce the risk of mud, flooding and traffic accidents during the rainy season, helping children (especially girls and children with disabilities) reach school more safely.

Shortening commuting time: Improving roads between remote villages and schools can reduce the burden of children walking for hours every day to go to school, increasing their learning time and physical strength.

Reducing dropout rates: Convenient transportation makes families more willing to send their children to school rather than leaving them behind to do housework or farm work.</p>

    <h3>
       Health and life safety
    </h3>

    <p>Improve emergency access: Repair roads leading to medical institutions to ensure that children can get timely treatment when they are sick or injured, reducing mortality.

Reduce traffic accidents: Add street lights, sidewalks, speed bumps and school zone signs to protect children from vehicle collisions (Cambodia has a high traffic accident mortality rate).

Support school bus services: Donations can fund school buses or safe transportation to reduce the danger of children walking long distances.</p>

    <h3>
        Economic and Community Development
    </h3>

    <p>Increased family income: Good roads help transport agricultural products and develop local businesses, improve family economic conditions, and indirectly support children's education and nutrition.

Attracting educational resources: Villages with convenient transportation are more likely to attract teachers and volunteers, improving the quality of school teaching.

Promoting social equity: Children in remote areas can access resources similar to those in cities (such as libraries and training centers) through road connections.</p>
