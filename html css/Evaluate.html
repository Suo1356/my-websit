<div class="title">EVALUATE</div>

<div class="map">


<li>
<h2>
‚úÖPositive aspects
</h2>
<h3>1. Aid is vital for basic development</h3>
<div>International organizations generally believe that since its post-war reconstruction in the 1990s, Cambodia has made great progress in education, medical care, rural infrastructure, water conservancy, and epidemic prevention with the help of international donations.</div>
<div>Institutions such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provide technical and financial support every year, and emphasize that such assistance "has changed the fate of millions of people."</div>
</li>

<li>
<h2>
‚úÖPositive aspects
</h2>
<h3>2. Humanitarian donation recognized</h3>
<div>The construction projects of NGOs and volunteers (such as digging wells, building schools, and repairing temples) have been praised by many international volunteers, charitable foundations, and individuals as good deeds that are "direct, visible, and full of human care."</div>
<div>For example, some Buddhist groups in countries such as Australia, Japan, and Singapore donated money to build temples and schools, which was praised by the media as "the practice of Buddhist co-prosperity in Southeast Asia."</div>
</li>


<li>
<h2>
‚úÖPositive aspects
</h2>
<h3>3. Strengthening international friendships</h3>
<div>Cambodian officials and media often express gratitude for assistance from countries and regions such as China, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union.</div>
<div>China's large-scale investment and aid projects in Cambodia (such as hospitals, roads, irrigation, and hydropower) are seen as a positive manifestation of the "Belt and Road" initiative.</div>

</li>


<li>
<h2>
‚ö†Ô∏è Neutral or critical voice
</h2>
<h3>1. Concerns about transparency of some donations</h3>
<div>International organizations and some media (such as Human Rights Watch and Transparency International) have pointed out that some aid funds have been improperly used by governments or intermediary agencies, and that there have been problems such as corruption, inefficiency or uneven resource distribution.</div>
<div>For example, there are reports that some villages have built wells but no one maintains them, or that some assisted schools have been short of teachers for a long time, affecting sustainability.</div>
</li>


<li>
<h2>
‚ö†Ô∏è Neutral or critical voice
</h2>
<h3>2. The risks of over-reliance on foreign aid</h3>
<div>Some economists worry that Cambodia is too dependent on donations and foreign aid and has failed to form a complete internal development driving mechanism.</div>
<div>Some international commentators have pointed out that if a country's governance capacity is not improved, long-term reliance on external resources may inhibit the country's reform momentum.</div>
</li>

<li>
<h2>
‚ö†Ô∏è Neutral or critical voice
</h2>
<h3>3. ‚ÄúCharity tourism sparks controversy</h3>
<div>Some media and researchers in Europe and the United States have criticized individual "charitable donations" as being more like tourist experiences or "gesture donations" that ignore real long-term construction needs.</div>
<div>For example, the "Volunteer Orphanage" project has been criticized for fueling the "orphan industry" in which children are used in exchange for aid resources.</div>
