<h3>Cambodia-Introduction</h3>
<p>The Kingdom of Cambodia is located in the southern part of the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia, bordering Vietnam to the east, Thailand to the west, Laos to the north, and the Gulf of Siam to the south. The country covers an area of ​​about 180,000 square kilometers, with Phnom Penh as its capital. The country has a population of about 16 million, of which the Khmer people account for more than 80%, and there are about 1.1 million overseas Chinese. The official language is Khmer (Cambodian). The main religion is Buddhism, and the Buddhist New Year (mid-April each year) and Independence Day (November 9) are important holidays.

    <h3>
        🏫School or classroom
    </h3>

    <p>Improve the level of education: Many rural areas in Cambodia have rudimentary or completely missing school facilities. Donating to build new schools can significantly improve the learning environment for local children and promote universal education.

Block the intergenerational transmission of poverty: Education is the fundamental means of long-term poverty alleviation. Children who receive education will have more opportunities to find jobs and improve their family life in the future.

Promoter of gender equality: Many girls drop out of school due to transportation or safety reasons. Building adjacent classrooms can increase the enrollment rate of girls and promote gender equality.

Enhance community cohesion: A school is often the center of a village. Activities held by the school can consolidate neighborhood relations and enhance the sense of participation of villagers.

Donations can leave a name: Usually, donors can set up a plaque at the school gate or set up a donation memorial wall in the classroom to leave a good name.

    <h3>
        🚰 Drilling wells / building clean water systems
    </h3>

    <p>Improve drinking water safety: Some villages still drink polluted river water, and wells can directly provide clean groundwater, reducing waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea.

Save labor and time: Residents, especially women and children, often have to walk several kilometers every day to get water. Wells can reduce the distance to get water and save a lot of time.

Improve the quality of life: Clean water can be used for bathing, cleaning, and irrigation, improving the overall hygiene and quality of life of villagers.

Low cost and fast results: A well only requires a small amount of money, short construction time, and can be completed in a few days, quickly benefiting many people.

Low maintenance cost: Most wells only need to be regularly checked and the filter replaced in the future, and they have strong long-term use.</p>

    <h3>
         🌉 Building bridges and roads (small transportation infrastructure)
    </h3>

    <p>Breaking through the bottleneck of travel: During the rainy season, some villages in Cambodia are "isolated from the world" due to muddy roads and swollen rivers. Small bridges or stone roads can ensure access.

Promoting economic circulation: Improving roads can make it easier to transport agricultural products to the market, boosting villagers' income.

Improving the efficiency of schooling and medical treatment: students and patients can reach schools and medical stations faster, improving the access rate of health and education services.

Improving safety: Many areas still use single-plank bridges and dilapidated bridges. Building solid bridges will greatly reduce the incidence of accidents such as falling into the river.

The project is highly commemorative: A memorial stone tablet can be set up on the bridge, engraved with the name of the donor or family, and become a permanent record.</p>
